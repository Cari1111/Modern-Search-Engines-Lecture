    "    - The frontier queue could be ranked by the context of the links where links with medical context like from a post about COVID are ranked higher than random links without additional information. This could also be used to avoid unhelpful links (a post about gaming will rarely link to information about COVID)\n",
    "  - give higher priority to links with keywords like 'covid', 'pandemic', ... OR to all links that appear in sentences with these keywords\n",
    "  - give low priority to all webpages that were updated before 2020. (A website that for example talks about general things about pandemics could still be useful information about COVID, so filtering them out completely would not be good)\n",
    "  - give medical sites like hospitals/clinics, higher priority. It would be helpful to have a list of hospitals or medical orientations.\n",
    "- To avoid unnecessary crawling you could rank pages on their relevance related to COVID and if they rank below a certain threshold their URLs are not added to the frontier. But this could lead to the crawler missing out/not finding interesting pages hidden behind boring pages."
